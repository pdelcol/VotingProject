Group 4 investigation of Group 6
Date: 17 April 2018

The investigation of Group 6's Automated Vulnerability Detector was somewhat short due to the fact that the
program's focus was on evaluating the securty of websites; hence, there being no data to protect. However,
with this in mind, the group's program  evaluted the security strength of websites, given the corresponding
URL as input, successfully in respect to the attacks that were proclaimed to be detectable. Subsequently,
Group 6 was unable to discover any security flaws in the AVD program. Although a comment should be made
that group 6 should have specified the required packages one would need to install in order to get their
programming running in their README.txt file.
