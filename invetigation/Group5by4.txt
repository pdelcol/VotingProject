Group 4 investigation of Group 5

Group 5s program is a secure election voting system. Our initial investigation led us to look at the basic security issues
that most websites face such as sql injection and other minor attacks which the website seems to handle well.

The next part of our investigation led us to design choices and implementation which is where we did find an issue
with the design of the project. One of the issues we ran across was that the implementation of the voting system allowed
anyone to sign up and register. Based on the way the registration system and voting system works, anyone can write
a simple application that dumps in random values for the registration and grabs the public/private key. It can then be
programmed to vote automatically as well. Now normally this would just be design choices or the difference between production
and user testing but in our opinion the program is compromised if anyone is allowed to register and vote with no restrictions.

Another item of note is that you guys are pulling the bootstrap CSS and JS from their CDN. While this is probably not going to
be an issue there was a point in the past where the CDN was compromised and was sending injected code to clients. For
this reason it is a recommendation to be prudent and to download the required libraries in case a breach does occur again.
Because of the reach of the bootstrap CDN it makes a very good target for hackers.
